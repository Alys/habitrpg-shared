Strong, frigid winds rush around as the shore begins to freeze over. Ice spikes jut up from the ground, pushing grass and dirt away. @Melynnrose and @Breadstrings run up to you.<br><br>\"Help!\" says @Melynnrose. \"We brought a giant penguin in to freeze the lake so we could all go ice skating, but we ran out of fish to feed him!\"<br><br>\"He got angry and is using his freeze breath on everything he sees!\" says @Breadstrings. \"Please, you have to subdue him before all of us are covered in ice!\" Looks like you need this penguin to... <em>cool down.</em>",
    "questPenguinCompletion": "Upon the penguin's defeat, the ice melts away. The giant penguin settles down in the sunshine, slurping up an extra bucket of fish you found. He skates off across the lake, blowing gently downwards to create smooth, sparkling ice. What an odd bird! \"It appears he left behind a few eggs, as well,\" says @Painter de Cluster. <br><br>@Rattify laughs. \"Maybe these penguins will be a little more... chill?\"",
